/**
 * Tells how many fingers came down together and how many times in a row, the way the
 * iOS fixture's fifteen tap recognizers do: a lower count waits until a higher one can
 * no longer follow, so a triple tap is reported once rather than as one, two and three.
 *
 * Android has no tap recognizers to declare, so the View and Compose fixtures both feed
 * raw pointer changes in here. Call [down] when the first finger lands, [pointers] as
 * more join, and [up] when the last one lifts. Main thread only.
